### Background
> The clients liked the earthquake map created with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, they would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

### Overview
> * Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

> * Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

> * Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

### Results:

A map that has three views: Streets, Satellite and Dark. 
The map also contains three layers that can filter the data : All Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates and Major Earthquakes.

## Summary

Each earthquake is represented by a circle marker with color that corresponds to magnitude. In other words the higher the magnitude the darker the color and the larger the diameter. Each circle marker once clicked has a popup marker that shows the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.
